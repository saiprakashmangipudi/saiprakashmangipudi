      <section id="about">
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I began my career in finance and controlling, which shaped a rigorous analytical approach to decision-making. Transitioning into operations and supply chain leadership, I led large-scale transformations across Asia-Pacific—designing systems for growth that are efficient, resilient and sustainable.</p>
        <p>My work marries governance, risk management and operational delivery. I focus on pragmatic sustainability: policies that are board-ready and programs that suppliers can implement.</p>
